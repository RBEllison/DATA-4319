# Resources
Resources, include data and images, and can be found in the [ _resources](). All images are public domain. Datasets were downloaded from Kaggle.com


# Tech and Framework Used
- R
- Markdown
- Latex

# How to use
Each algorithm contains two files; a .pdf and .Rmd. You can view the content by clicking on the PDF. You can also download main.Rmd and open it in Rstudio to view and alter the source code.
